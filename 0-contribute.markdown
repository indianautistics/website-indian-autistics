### To contribute, open the text editor [here](https://www.indianautistics.com/editor.html).

#### What the text editor does
The editor will save what you're writing on the browser you wrote it on. For example, if you wrote something on it on your laptop with the Google Chrome browser, if you close it and open it again the next day on your laptop and with Chrome, whatver you typed will still be there.

The page lets you submit as well, which will simply take everything there and pre-compose an email to this blog's maintainer.

I'm eager to hear from you!
