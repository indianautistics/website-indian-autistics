Autism is characterised by...neurotypicals mostly. All autistic traits are seen from their perspective, one that they often consider 'default' or 'neutral' while autistic traits are seen as the other. Inherently shoved into a hierarchy that their brains like to work in.

The only people who have a right to talk about us, is us as individuals for our individual selves.

Autistic people aren't expressionless, neurotypicals just can't read our expressions, just like we can't read theirs very well.

Do they ever stop to consider the problem might be on their side too?

#### Autistic people don't "suddenly get angry"

We don't even realise it ourselves when something's been slowly pushing us over the edge, we only realise it at the last straw. Perhaps if they used some of that empathy they say they have, they could figure that out.

#### Autistic people are very deeply empathic

Since our expressions are unreadable by neurotypicals and they can't imagine that someone might be showing empathy but they can't see it, neurotypicals often think we don't feel.

Nothing could be further from the truth. I end up crying pretty easily at movies and tv shows. Real people matter even more than that. Heck even objects have significance that others might not develop.

I care very much about a lot of things and write poetry about it too. I deeply love people in my life.

Considering the state of the neurotypical run world, can you really call neurotypicals empathetic?

Like everything else I'm saying here, it's mostly about me. I've seen many autistics who share this deep empathy and then there's very likely autistics like Mark Zuckerberg out to break the world. We are not a monolith.

#### We are not a monolith

If you've met one autistic person you've met one autistic person. I didn't coin this phrase but have realised it's truth over and over again. Everything I've mentioned here might be true _generally_ but isn't true for everyone and the details may vary immensely. This is just one autistic person's perspective, and I welcome all other autistic people's perspectives.

Autism is characterised by a deep inner world that drives our actions. One that cannot be understood by just looking at us. You've got to talk to us and ask us why.

You'll always get a straight answer.
