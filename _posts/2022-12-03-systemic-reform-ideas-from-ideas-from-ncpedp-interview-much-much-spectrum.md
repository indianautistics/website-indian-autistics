I was watching [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI4hcQKRsdI) of Arman Ali from by Much Much Media. I've struggled to find ways to help myself with my disability and these methods are essential what we need to help everyone though is a systemic effort like what

National Center for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People was created for building systems and dealing with the challenges of _scaling_ accessibility. Something that has different challenges and approaches from dealing with things individuality.

Some points from the interview that I just want to remember myself.

1. One organization that keeps track of all disability requirements is helpful so large corporations etc don't have to go to 100 different orgs to find what's needed.
2. Interviewing as many disabled people as possible and coming up with a standard helps creating rules that ensure the most dignity for all.
   1. One example of this was the rule that ramps have to be 1/12 as in for every 1 foot of vertical height, there has to be 21 feet of horizontal distance for the ramp. This ensures a gradient that makes going up the ramp possible unaided for a lot of people.
   2. If you'd asked only people who had known short ramps their entire lives who'd been pushed up by it with two people helping even this seems a great achievement but we can aim for more.

As with any organization that's making things for people it's important to keep talking with the users of those services, disabled people in this case, to see what we can do better to support everyone.

A standardized body that is updated with feedback from all will be really helpful to ensure even those who cannot fight for themselves can get the supports they need to thrive.
