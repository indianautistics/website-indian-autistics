This scale might help quantify what level of anxiety you're facing. When your anxiety is too high for too long you're more likely to engage in maladaptive behaviour.  
Anything from social media scrolling for hours on end to eating disorders or substance abuse.  
Rather than this, if you find yourself at 4 or higher more than once a month, you might need to make drastic changes in your life to get away from the causes of the anxiety or actual anti-anxiety meds to deal with worry without a cause.

Phase 1 - no anxiety 
Phase 2- worry
Phase 3- longer term worry
Phase 4- on the verge of spiralling but still in control
Phase 5- physical and mental manifestations complete, super anxiety mode on- can't sit, can't think
Will shake and stop breathing everytime they stop distracting themselves 
Phase 6- can't breathe
Phase 7- can't stop shaking- emergency
