Hey!

This was an early post while I was figuring out how to make this site work. Feel free to look at it as an example that things can be hard but it's worth doing them anyway :)

Got this working after some very frustrating trouble with jekyll. But it looks like it's working now.

Whew, nearly got this working the way I prefer, just got some simple forestry layout things to edit =/

Looks like everything is still too broken to use.

Links to blogs don't work and the css seems to be missing.

Lol, I'd posted this to pages instead of posts.

Looks like it was an issue with the baseurl. Might work now.

Does this really work? Looks like the blog isn't being updated.
