As is well known there are no autistics alike anymore than two people of any kind are alike.

This inevitably results in differences in approaches on how to do things.

What do we do when this happens? When someone else is doing something that we possibly can't imagine working?

Impact is foremost, intent is a ragged fickle indicator only. So in this case, we examine the intent of the person and if that comes up clean we do wait for the impact.

I do hope I'm not the only one who has good ideas. I'd love so much to be just one person doing a little good among a sea of people doing the same in their own ways.

I will evaluate intent for autistics doing work for fellow autistics and consider their actions through all possible charitable views even if testing some of them.

I hope when I think something will not work, I am proven wrong again and again. Serving fellow autistics is first.

Thanks a lot to Sudhanshu who noted how often autistics actually turn on each other to make me really think about how this could play out and what role I may have when others don't agree with me.

Oh, and another thing, keep at the thing which you've determined is the pure white. Nothing is as shining an example as just the results of being right. The weight of success should be convincing beyond any idle word or debate.
